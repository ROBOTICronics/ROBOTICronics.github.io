>How to Write a Good Documentation

## Why to Write Documentation 

Documentation effectively connects humans and machines.

### Why writing documentation:

   * For you 
       * You will be using your code in 6 months
       * You want people to use your code and give you credit
       * You want to learn self-determination
       * Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
   * For others: 
        Others can easily use your code and build upon it
   * For science:
       * Advance the science
       * Encourage open science 
       * Allow reproducibility and transparency
