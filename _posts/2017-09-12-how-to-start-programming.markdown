>How to Write a Good Documentation

## Why to Write Documentation 

Documentation effectively connects humans and machines.

### Why writing documentation:

   * For you 
       * You will be using your code in 6 months
       * You want people to use your code and give you credit
       * You want to learn self-determination
       * Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
   * For others: 
        Others can easily use your code and build upon it
   * For science:
       * Advance the science
       * Encourage open science 
       * Allow reproducibility and transparency

## Best Practices for Documenting Your Project 

### Best practices for writing documentation:

    * Include A README file that contains
        * A brief description of the project
        * Installation instructions
        * A short example/tutorial

    * Allow issue tracker for others
    * Write an API documentation
        * What a function do
        * What the function's parameters or arguments are
        * What a function returns
    * Document your code
    * Apply coding conventions, such as file organization, comments, naming conventions, programming practices, etc.

    * Include information for contributors
    * Include citation information
    * Include licensing information
    * Link to your e-mail address at the end
    * List all the version of the files along with the major edits you did in each version

### An important tip: Naming files should be descriptive and consistent!
