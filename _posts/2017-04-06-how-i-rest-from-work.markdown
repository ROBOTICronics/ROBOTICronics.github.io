## Newton's 3 Laws of Motion

### First Law:
what is at rest will stay at rest and what is in motion will stay in motion, unless there is an external force acting on it.

### Second Law:
the force required to accelerate an object to a certain velocity depends on the mass (F=ma).

### Third Law:
for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

* Based off of the first law, a drone will stay on the unless you decide to move it. A drone will move if you move it.

* Based off of the second law, it is clear if you have a lighter drone, you will have longer flight times (less force required to accelerate it), quicker reaction time (if you decide to put more force, the drone will accelerate faster), and better maneuverability.

* Based off of the third law, drone propellers throw air down with a certain force, the air molecules will push up on the propellers with the same force, therefore the drone moves up. There is another aspect to this law however, and is the fact that anything rotating will generate a small spinning force in the opposite direction, called torque. Just like how a person needs to "push off" against the ground in order to walk forwards, the motor needs to continuously "push off" against something in order to rotate. That is why if helicopters only have the main rotor, the torque generated by the main propeller will send the body of the helicopter spinning in the opposite direction, and it needs a small rotor on the tail to prevent that.

_X-axis:_ the axis that points left/right or west/east

_Y-axis:_ the axis that points forwards/backwards or north/south

_Z-axis:_ the axis that points up/down

_Roll:_ when the aerial vehicle tilts left/right; rotates about the y axis

_Pitch:_ when the aerial vehicle tilts forwards/backwards; rotates about the x axis

_Yaw:_ when the aerial vehicle spins in place left or right; rotates about the z axis

_Degrees of Freedom (DOF):_ the number of independent factors that can be assessed (I'll explain this term in better detail later, with an example)

***Helicopters***
have one main propeller that can provide the acceleration, but need the small rotor in the back to counteract the torque created by the big spinning propeller. Additionally, there are countless other control mechanisms to physically tilt the main propeller in order for the helicopter to move in the 2D-plane.

***Bicopters***
have two equal-sized counter-rotating propellers that provide the acceleration, roll, and the yaw control, but needs the assistance of two servos to tilt the propellers in order to maintain balance and control the pitch.

***Tricopters***
have three equal-sized propellers that provide the roll, pitch, and acceleration control. Two of the propellers spin clockwise and the remaining propeller spins counterclockwise. Due to the extra propeller spinning clockwise, there is no control over the yaw angle, so a servo must be use to tilt the last motor in order to compensate and gain yaw control.

***Quadcopters***
with four propellers, have the least amount of physical propellers and motors that can allow it to travel in 4 degrees of freedom (move linearly in the x-axis, move linearly in the y-axis, move linearly in the z-axis, and accelerate). However, if one motor fails, it will be the demise of the quadcopter.....unless there is specific code that can compensate.

***Exacopters and Octocopters***
have 6 and 8 propellers, respectively. They offer an advantage over quadcopters that if it loses one propeller, it will still be able to and safely, but at the cost of increase complexity, decreased flight time, higher cost, and less maneuverability.

Unlike planes, quadcopters are naturally unstable and will need software assistance. Overall, the greatest challenge in the construction of the quadcopter will not be the hardware, but instead, the code itself.

## Vertical Motion

Drones use rotors for propulsion and control. All forces come in pairs, which means that while the rotor spinning blades push down on the air, the air pushes up on the rotor.  More, the lift comes down to controlling the upward and downward force: the faster the rotors spin, the greater the lift, and vice-versa.
###hover, climb, descend.

* ***_To hover_***. Easy, the net thrust of the four rotors pushing the drone up must be equal to the gravitational force pulling it down.

* ***_To climb_***. Easy, just increase the speed (_thrust_) of the four rotors so that there is a non-zero upward force that is greater than the weight. Now, there are three forces on the drone: weight, thrust, and air drag; so, the thrusters need to be greater than for just a hover.

* _***To descend***_, the opposite of climbing. Easy, decrease the rotor speed (_thrust_) so the net force is downward.

## Direction

![The rotors diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/spring_2017_sketches_key4.jpg)

The configuration shown above, the red rotors are rotating counterclockwise, so have a positive angular momentum; the green ones are rotating clockwise, so have a negative angular momentum. With the two sets of rotors rotating in opposite directions, the total angular momentum is zero. Angular momentum is obtained by multiplying the angular velocity by the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia deals with rotation (instead of mass), depending on how fast the rotors spin.
...in this configuration, the total angular momentum is zero.

Let us suppose to decrease the angular velocity of rotor 1 such that now it has a smaller angular momentum. If nothing else happened, the total angular momentum of the drone would now be greater than zero. Of course, that can't happen. So the drone rotates clockwise so that the body of the drone has an angular momentum of -1. Boom. Rotation. But, decreasing the spin of rotor 1 (did indeed cause the drone to rotate) also decreased the thrust from rotor 1 so that the net upward force does not equal the gravitational force, causing the drone to descend, because the thrust forces aren't balanced, in the direction of rotor 1.

To avoid all these problems, please decrease the spin of rotor 1 and 3 and increase the spin for rotors 2 and 4, so that the angular momentum of the rotors still doesn't add up to zero, so the drone body must rotate, except that the total force remains equal to the gravitational force and the drone continues to hover. Since the lower thrust rotors are diagonally opposite from each other, the drone can still stay balanced.

## Forwards, Backwards, Sideways

The drone is symmetrical, so moving forward is equal to moving backward.

The drone is symmetrical, so previous assumption holds true for side-to-side motion.

***How to create a forward component of thrust from the rotors of a drone moving at a constant speed.*** Let us suppose to increase the rotation rate of rotors 3 and 4 (the rear ones) while decreasing the rate of rotors 1 and 2: the total thrust force will remain equal to the weight, so the drone will stay at the same vertical level. Also, the increased rotation of those rotors will still produce zero angular momentum, since one of the rear rotors is spinning counterclockwise and the other clockwise.
![How to fly forward]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/spring_2017_sketches_key5.jpg)

The same holds true for the front rotors, so the drone does not rotate. However, the greater force in the back of the drone means it will tilt forward. Now, a slight increase in thrust for all rotors will produce a net thrust force that has a component to balance the weight along with a forward motion component.

## Pitch

Once the drone in flight is perfectly stable, to make it:

* ***move forward*** we should act on pitch: the rotation speed of the ***M3*** and ***M4*** ***rear motors*** must be ***increased***, while the rotation speed of the M1 and M2 front motors must decreased,
* ***bring back*** increase the rotation speed of the M1 and M2 front motors and decrease the rotation speed of the M3 and M4 rear motors.

Pls, note that  the reference is respect to the observer.

## Roll

Once the drone in flight is perfectly stable, to make it:

* ***move sideways***, by varying the speed of the motors in such a way as to be able to tilt the quadcopter to one side, thus allowing it to be moved to the right or left. The reference is respect to the observer.

## Yaw

that's, the rotation on itself, by varying the rotation speed of two motors positioned in the same axis.

## The elements as listed in order to fly

***Frame, the “backbone” of the quadcopter***. The frame is what keeps all the parts of the helicopter together. It has to be sturdy, but on the other hand, it also has to be light so that the motors and the batteries don’t struggle to keep it in the air.

Although it might be tempting to buy a preassembled frame kit, building the frame on your own can help you kick start your true DIY process. The Frame of your quadcopter has to possess strength, but it also has to be flexible enough to compensate for the vibrations the motors produce. It needs to have the following parts:

* _enter Holding Plate_ ... for mounting the electronics.
* _Arms_ ... for instance, there are four arms on a quadcopter.
* _Motor Brackets_ ... you need four of them on a quadcopter, so that you can connect the motors on each arms end.

The frame can be made of aluminum, carbon fiber or wood, but the material that is mostly used for the arms is aluminum. More precisely, the square hollow rails of the arms are made of aluminum. They are relatively lightweight, rigid and cheap. Since they are not known as great compensators for the motor vibrations like carbon fiber ones are, they can confuse the sensors.

Carbon fiber offers much better absorption of the motor vibrations and is the most rigid one; on the other side, it is also the most expensive one. Carbon fiber is the superior choice, but this very much depends on your personal budget.

Wood boards are also better for motor vibration absorbtion, but are quite fragile and can break easily in the event of a crash. You can also opt for a frame that is pre-made and only needs assembling

***Motors***. The thrust that allows the quadcopter to get airborne is provided by Brushless DC motors and each of them is separately controlled by an ***E***lectronic ***S***peed ***C***ontroller (ESC).

***ESC***. The Electronic Speed Controller is like a nerve that delivers the movement information from the flight controller (the supervisor) to the motors (as arm or leg muscles). It regulates how much power the motors get, which determines the speed and direction changes of the drone.

***Propellers***. Depending on the type of a quad you build, you can use: i) 5-inch racing props for less thrust but more speed, ii) 9 to 10/11-inch props to obtain stable, aerial photography flights.

***Battery***. You can choose from 2S, 3S, 4S, or even 5S batteries, depending on how much the maximum voltage level has been setup. But, for a standard for a quad that is planned to be used for aerial filming or photography (just an example), you will need a 11.4 V 3S battery. You could go with the 22.8 V 4S if you are building a racing drone, causing the motors to spin a lot faster.

***Arduino board***. The choice of the specific model depends on the type of the drone to build.

***IMU***. Basically a board that is a sum of various sensors that help the drone know where it is and how to level itself.

***RC Controller*** The choice of the transmitter depends on the choice of the protocol to use and the signal receiver that is onboard the drone.
