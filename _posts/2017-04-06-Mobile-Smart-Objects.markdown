## The management of connected objects.
The development of ever smaller devices with minimal energy consumption allows a long battery life. Stack-less or battery-less devices are more interesting
since batteries, even if of long duration, constitute an obstacle to the diffusion of smart objects. On the other hand, strong in requiring a limited power
that can be obtained, as an example, from vibration induced by a mechanical movement of a motor or from very small photovoltaic panels,
some smart objects will always be equipped with a buffer battery that is recharged according to the availability of the energy source.

However, there are other small devices that can work in the absence of an energy accumulator: for example, we are talking about ... real devices that can be powered
also able to provide up to 20 mA of current for a few moments, sufficient to power a microcontroller capable of sampling the signal from a sensor and transmitting the read value to a smartphone for further processing.
